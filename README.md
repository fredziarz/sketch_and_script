## üéØ Vision

Most people see architecture and software development as completely separate worlds. This portfolio challenges that notion. Both fields require:

- **Creative problem-solving** - Whether designing a functional living space or debugging complex code
- **Attention to detail** - From precise measurements to pixel-perfect interfaces
- **User-centric thinking** - Understanding how people interact with spaces and software
- **Systematic approach** - Balancing aesthetics with functionality

**Sketch & Script** represents the intersection of these disciplines, demonstrating how systematic thinking enhances design, and creative vision enriches technical work.

## üìê What You'll Find Here

### **Architecture & Interior Design**
Transforming spaces into experiences. Projects showcasing:
- Residential and commercial design
- Space planning and optimization
- Interior styling and aesthetics
- Functional, beautiful environments that reflect how people live

### **QA Engineering & Development**
Building quality through code. Projects featuring:
- Quality assurance and systematic testing
- Web application development
- Game development (coding meets creativity)
- Robust, user-friendly software solutions

---

## üé® Design Philosophy

The portfolio itself embodies this dual identity:

**Split Personality**
- **Light theme** for architecture - open, airy, minimalist
- **Dark theme** for coding - focused, technical, modern
- Seamless transitions between both worlds

**Accessibility First**
- Fully keyboard navigable (WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliant)
- Thoughtful UX that works for everyone
- Responsive design for all devices

**Performance Matters**
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript - no bloated frameworks
- Fast loading times (<2 seconds)
- Optimized for both user experience and search engines

---

## üí° The Story Behind the Name

**Sketch** - The creative process of architecture and design. Visual thinking, spatial planning, bringing ideas to life through drawings and 3D visualization.

**Script** - The logical precision of coding. Systematic problem-solving, writing elegant solutions, building reliable software.

Both disciplines start with a blank canvas - whether it's a floor plan or an empty file. Both transform ideas into tangible results that serve real human needs.
