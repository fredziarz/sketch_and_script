---

## Adding to Portfolio Pages

Your project file is saved, but it won't show in the portfolio yet. You need to add it to the listing page.

### For Architecture Projects

#### 1. Open `architecture.html`

```bash
# In your editor
code architecture.html
```

#### 2. Find the Projects Section

Look for:
```html
<div class="projects-grid" id="projects-grid">
```

#### 3. Add Project Card

Add this structure **at the top** of the grid:

```html
<article class="project-card" data-category="[category]" data-tags="[tags]">
    <a href="projects/architecture-project-10.html" class="project-link">
        <div class="project-image">
            <img src="[cover-image-path]" alt="[project-title]">
        </div>
        <div class="project-info">
            <h3>[Project Title]</h3>
            <p class="project-year">[Year]</p>
            <p class="project-description">[Short description]</p>
            <div class="project-tags">
                <span class="tag">[tag1]</span>
                <span class="tag">[tag2]</span>
            </div>
        </div>
    </a>
</article>
```

#### 4. Fill in the Values

Replace the placeholders:
- `[category]` ‚Üí Your project category (residential, commercial, etc.)
- `[tags]` ‚Üí Comma-separated tags
- `architecture-project-10.html` ‚Üí Your file name
- `[cover-image-path]` ‚Üí Path to cover image
- `[project-title]` ‚Üí Your project title
- `[Year]` ‚Üí Project year
- `[Short description]` ‚Üí Brief description
- `[tag1]`, `[tag2]` ‚Üí Individual tags

#### 5. Save the File

```bash
# Save in your editor
Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S on Mac)
```

### For Coding Projects

Same process, but edit `coding.html` instead.

**Game projects go in `coding.html`** with category="game"

---

## Testing Locally

Before deploying, always test locally!

### Step 1: Ensure Dev Server is Running

```bash
# If not running:
./start-both-servers.sh
```

### Step 2: Open Dev Site

Visit: http://localhost:8000

### Step 3: Navigate to Portfolio Page

- Click "Architecture" or "QA & Development"
- Your new project should appear in the grid

### Step 4: Click Your Project

- Opens your new project page
- Check all images load
- Read through content
- Test all links

### Step 5: Check Different Views

**Desktop:**
- Full screen (1920px+)
- Medium screen (1024px)

**Mobile:**
- Open browser dev tools (F12)
- Toggle device toolbar
- Test on different device sizes:
  - iPhone (375px)
  - iPad (768px)
  - Android (360px)

### Step 6: Test Navigation

- Click "Back" button
- Use keyboard (Tab, Enter)
- Test filter/search if applicable

### Common Issues to Check

- [ ] Images load correctly
- [ ] No broken links
- [ ] Text is readable
- [ ] Mobile layout works
- [ ] Project appears in grid
- [ ] Filters work (if tagged)
- [ ] Theme is correct
- [ ] Smooth transitions

---

## Deploying to Production

When everything works locally, it's time to go live!

### Step 1: Stop the Servers

```bash
./stop-servers.sh
```

### Step 2: Check Git Status

```bash
git status
```

You should see:
- `modified: architecture.html` or `coding.html`
- `new file: projects/[your-project].html`
- Possibly `modified: images/...` if you added new images

### Step 3: Review Changes

```bash
git diff architecture.html
# or
git diff coding.html
```

Make sure only your new project card was added.

### Step 4: Stage Changes

```bash
git add architecture.html  # or coding.html
git add projects/[your-new-file].html
git add images/  # if you added images
```

### Step 5: Commit

```bash
git commit -m "Add new project: [Project Name]"
```

**Good commit messages:**
- "Add new project: Modern Apartment Redesign"
- "Add coding project: E-commerce Testing Framework"
- "Add game: Space Explorer 2D"

### Step 6: Push to Dev Branch

```bash
git push origin dev
```

### Step 7: Run Publish Script

```bash
./publish.sh
```

**What the script does:**
1. Checks you're on the right branch
2. Pulls latest changes
3. Merges dev ‚Üí main
4. Pushes to GitHub
5. Triggers GitHub Pages deployment

### Step 8: Wait for Deployment

- GitHub Pages takes 2-3 minutes
- You'll see "Deploying..." in GitHub Actions
- Wait for "Deployment successful"

### Step 9: Verify on Live Site

1. Open https://www.sketchandscript.pl
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Navigate to your portfolio page
4. Click your new project
5. Verify everything works

### Step 10: Clear Cache if Needed

If you don't see changes:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Try incognito/private mode
3. Try different browser
4. Wait another 2-3 minutes

## Troubleshooting

### CMS Won't Load

**Problem:** http://localhost:8080 shows error

**Solutions:**
1. Check if server is running:
   ```bash
   lsof -ti:8080
   ```
2. Restart servers:
   ```bash
   ./stop-servers.sh
   ./start-both-servers.sh
   ```
3. Check for errors in terminal

### Images Won't Upload

**Problem:** Image upload fails or hangs

**Solutions:**
1. Check file size (max 5MB)
2. Try different format (JPG instead of PNG)
3. Compress image first
4. Try smaller image
5. Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Generated HTML Missing Images

**Problem:** HTML file doesn't show images

**Solutions:**
1. Images should be embedded as base64
2. Check if images uploaded successfully in CMS
3. Regenerate HTML
4. Check image file formats

### Project Not Showing in Portfolio

**Problem:** Can't find new project on portfolio page

**Solutions:**
1. Check you added project card to portfolio page
2. Verify file path in card is correct
3. Check category matches filters
4. Hard refresh page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
5. Check console for JavaScript errors

### "File Not Found" Error

**Problem:** Clicking project shows 404

**Solutions:**
1. Verify file name matches link in portfolio card
2. Check file is in `projects/` folder
3. Check spelling and capitalization
4. Verify file has `.html` extension

### Changes Not Showing on Live Site

**Problem:** Deployed but old version still showing

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 5 minutes (GitHub Pages can be slow)

### CMS Data Lost

**Problem:** Projects disappeared from CMS

**Solutions:**
1. CMS uses LocalStorage (browser-specific)
2. Check you're using same browser
3. Check browser storage not cleared
4. HTML files are still safe in `projects/` folder
5. Can recreate CMS entries if needed

### Port Already in Use

**Problem:** Error starting servers
