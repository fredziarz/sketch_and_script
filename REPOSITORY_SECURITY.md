# Repository Security Guide

Complete guide to securing your GitHub repository and preventing unauthorized changes.

---

## üîí Current Security Status

**Repository:** github.com/fredziarz/sketch_and_script
**Owner:** fredziarz (Micha≈Ç Wicherek)
**Visibility:** Public (required for GitHub Pages)
**Authentication:** SSH (secure) ‚úÖ

---

## ‚úÖ Default Protections (Already Active)

Your repository is secure by default:

‚úÖ **Owner-only write access** - Only you can push commits
‚úÖ **SSH authentication** - Secure key-based access
‚úÖ **Public = read-only** - Others can view but not modify
‚úÖ **No collaborators** - Nobody else has permissions
‚úÖ **GitHub Pages enabled** - Site is public, code is protected

**Important:** Public repository ‚â† Anyone can edit. Only viewing is public!

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Recommended Security Enhancements

### 1. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

**Priority:** HIGH - Do this first!

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/security
2. Click: **"Enable two-factor authentication"**
3. Choose method:
   - **Authenticator app** (Google Authenticator, Authy) - Recommended
   - **SMS** - Fallback option
4. Scan QR code with authenticator app
5. Enter 6-digit code to verify
6. **Save recovery codes** - Store securely offline
7. Done! ‚úÖ

**Why?** Even if someone steals your password, they can't access your account without the 2FA code.

**Recovery codes:** Print and store in safe place (you'll need these if you lose your phone)

---

### 2. Branch Protection Rules

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Prevents accidental damage

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/fredziarz/sketch_and_script/settings/branches
2. Click: **"Add branch protection rule"**
3. Branch name pattern: `main`
4. Configure settings:

**Recommended settings:**
```
‚òë Require a pull request before merging
  ‚òê Require approvals (optional - useful if you add collaborators)

‚òê Require status checks to pass before merging
  (No CI/CD setup yet, skip this)

‚òê Require conversation resolution before merging
  (Optional)

‚òë Require signed commits
  (Verifies commits are from you)

‚òë Require linear history
  (Cleaner git history, prevents messy merges)

‚òê Do not allow bypassing the above settings
  (Check this if you want strict enforcement)

‚òê Allow force pushes
  (Leave unchecked - prevents accidental history rewrites)

‚òê Allow deletions
  (Leave unchecked - prevents accidental branch deletion)
```

**Note:** Some settings may require a paid GitHub plan. Free tier allows basic protection.

---

### 3. Review SSH Keys

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Ensure only your devices have access

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/keys
2. Review all listed SSH keys
3. For each key:
   - ‚úÖ Recognize the device? Keep it
   - ‚ùå Don't recognize it? Delete it immediately
4. Best practice: One key per device with descriptive names
   - Example: "Laptop-Ubuntu-2025", "Desktop-Work", "MacBook-Home"

**Add new SSH key:**
```bash
# On your computer, generate new key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "michalwicherek@gmail.com"

# Copy public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Add to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/ssh/new
```

**Security tips:**
- ‚ùå Never share your private key (`id_ed25519`)
- ‚úÖ Only share public key (`id_ed25519.pub`)
- ‚úÖ Use strong passphrase for SSH key
- ‚úÖ Keep private key on your devices only

---

### 4. Repository Access Control

**Priority:** HIGH - Regular audits

**Check collaborators:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/fredziarz/sketch_and_script/settings/access
2. Under "Who has access":
   - Should show: **Only you (fredziarz)**
   - If anyone else is listed: Click "Remove" immediately

**Manage access levels:**
- **Admin** - Full control (only you)
- **Write** - Can push code (nobody)
- **Read** - Can view only (public)

**Never add collaborators** unless you absolutely trust them and need their help.

---

### 5. Security Alerts & Scanning

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Automatic monitoring

**Enable security features:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/fredziarz/sketch_and_script/settings/security_analysis
2. Enable these:
   - ‚òë **Dependabot alerts** - Notifies of vulnerable dependencies
   - ‚òë **Dependabot security updates** - Auto-updates vulnerable packages
   - ‚òë **Secret scanning** - Detects leaked credentials

**Note:** Your site uses vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (no dependencies), so Dependabot won't find much. Still good to enable for future.

---

## üö´ What You Should NEVER Commit

### Critical Secrets

‚ùå **Private keys** (SSH, GPG, API keys for paid services)
‚ùå **Passwords** (database, admin, email)
‚ùå **Database credentials** (connection strings, usernames)
‚ùå **OAuth tokens** (GitHub personal access tokens)
‚ùå **Encryption keys** (SSL private keys, JWT secrets)
‚ùå **Environment variables** with sensitive data

### Exception: Public API Keys

‚úÖ **Web3Forms access key** - Designed to be public, only sends to your verified email
‚úÖ **Google Analytics ID** - Public tracking code
‚úÖ **Formspree endpoint** (if you used it) - Public form endpoint

**Your current setup is safe!** ‚úÖ

---

## üîê Additional Security Measures

### 1. Signed Commits (Advanced)

Verify that commits are actually from you:

**Setup GPG signing:**
```bash
# Generate GPG key
gpg --full-generate-key
# Choose: RSA and RSA, 4096 bits, 0 (no expiration)
# Enter: Your name and email

# List keys
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long

# Copy your key ID (after sec rsa4096/)
# Configure git
git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_KEY_ID
git config --global commit.gpgsign true

# Export public key
gpg --armor --export YOUR_KEY_ID

# Add to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/gpg/new
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Commits show "Verified" badge on GitHub
- ‚úÖ Proves commits are from you
- ‚úÖ Prevents impersonation

---

### 2. Disable Forking (Optional)

Prevent others from creating copies:

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/fredziarz/sketch_and_script/settings
2. Scroll to: **"Features"**
3. Uncheck: ‚òê **"Allow forking"**

**Considerations:**
- **Disable if:** You want complete control over copies
- **Keep enabled if:** You want to allow learning from your code
- **Current setting:** Probably enabled (default)

**Recommendation:** Keep enabled for portfolio visibility, disable if you add proprietary code.

---

### 3. Private Repository (Not Recommended for You)

**Option:** Make repository private

**How:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/fredziarz/sketch_and_script/settings
2. Scroll to: **"Danger Zone"**
3. Click: **"Change repository visibility"**
4. Select: **Private**

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** This will **break GitHub Pages** on the free tier!
- GitHub Pages requires public repository (free plan)
- Private repos need GitHub Pro ($4/month) for Pages

**Your situation:** Keep public for free hosting ‚úÖ

## üìö Best Practices

### Git Security

1. **Always use SSH, not HTTPS**
   ```bash
   # Good (SSH)
   git@github.com:fredziarz/sketch_and_script.git
   
   # Avoid (HTTPS - requires password/token)
   https://github.com/fredziarz/sketch_and_script.git
   ```

2. **Use meaningful commit messages**
   ```bash
   # Good
   git commit -m "Add contact form with Web3Forms integration"
   
   # Bad
   git commit -m "update"
   ```

3. **Never force push to main**
   ```bash
   # Dangerous - rewrites history
   git push --force origin main
   
   # Safe
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Review before pushing**
   ```bash
   git status      # See what's changed
   git diff        # Review changes
   git add .       # Stage files
   git commit -m   # Commit with message
   git push        # Push to GitHub
   ```

### Account Security

1. **Strong password**
   - 16+ characters
   - Mix of letters, numbers, symbols
   - Unique to GitHub (don't reuse)
   - Use password manager (LastPass, 1Password, Bitwarden)

2. **Email security**
   - Enable 2FA on email (michalwicherek@gmail.com)
   - Don't share email password
   - Monitor for suspicious emails

3. **Device security**
   - Keep SSH keys on encrypted drives
   - Lock your computer when away
   - Use antivirus/antimalware
   - Keep OS and software updated
